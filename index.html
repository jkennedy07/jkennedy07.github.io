        <p>When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Ensign Babyface! Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You enjoyed that. You did exactly what you had to do.</p>
        <p>You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Wouldn't that bring about chaos?
